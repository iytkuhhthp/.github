<h1>You Won't Regret Watching Alarum but Maybe Download it for the Headspace?</h1>

<p>Whoa, just stumbled outta the theater and seriously — I'm like half popcorn, half dazzled brain right now. Didn't expect <em>Alarum</em> to be this kinda rollercoaster! My back's stiff, might've been that seat, or maybe I was just too tense when that scene — you know, the one with the cat and the talking bell. 🐱🔔 Why did it feel like an existential crisis in Dolby surround?</p>

<p>Anyways, the theater was so loud, like louder than my uncle at a BBQ. People rustling everywhere. Still can taste the popcorn crumbs in my mouth — desperate crunch. Heard someone behind me, whispering, is this real? when the alarm went off in the scene. Which alarm tho? There were so many, like an alarm for my own life when I'm late. Gosh, download the movie, maybe watch it again? Work out the kinks in my brain.</p>

> <p>Then there was that surreal moment where the protagonist — who's kinda like a mix between a tired office worker and a dreamer, you know? — he just <em>looks</em> at the screen and says something about shadows that don’t even exist. I swear, it felt like a metaphor for my last relationship. 💔</p>

<p>Lemme just say, the colors were like a fever dream, scribbled by a toddler, but on purpose. I can't decide if I loved it or if it fried my neurons. Orchestra music swelling and then suddenly, a whisper — eerily close, like your name drawn in fog on a car window. Might need to watch the movie again or ask someone, did we see the same thing?</p>

<p>Phone’s buzzing, my friend asked earlier if they should download the movie. I'd say yes but maybe have a cup of tea ready, or a meditation app open, just in case. 🎬</p>

<p>Feels like I should’ve taken notes or something, but then, would that even make sense?! Anyhoo, if <em>Alarum</em> was a sandwich, it'd be one where you can’t be sure what’s the filling but it leaves you kinda full? I need water... 😅</p>

<p>Some dude at the exit mentioned something about the crescendo of chaos, and I get it — that’s basically my life right now. Join me on this odd voyage!</p>
